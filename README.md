# Building a Simple Distributed System

Project Description: In this project, I have designed and implemented a simple distributed system in Python. The distributed system includes the following components:

- Server Clustering: Multiple server instances running on different ports.
- Client Registration: Clients can register with a specific server instance.
- Data Sharing: Clients can share data with each other through the server.
- Fault Tolerance: The system should handle server failures gracefully.


## 1. Server Setup:

Creating multiple server instances each listening on a different port (8080,8081,8082) 

In the terminal, run python server8080.py 
- Server running on port 8080:

- Server running on port 8081:
